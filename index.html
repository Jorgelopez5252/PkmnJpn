          All of this is for help on GEN 1 Pokemon only from Japan. Gen 2 is the
          next step however!
        </h1>
        <p>
          The goal is to keep exposing you to the first two scripts of the
          Japanese "Lang". In this case Hiragana and Katakana.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wont be going over Kanji as its not used in Gen 1 and dont worry,
          these games were made for kids so its very basic level of japanese we
          are dealing with.
